# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A JSON Crack-like graph visualization feature that will be added to the existing JSON visualization app. This feature will provide an alternative view to the current tree structure, displaying JSON data as an interactive node-link diagram where objects, arrays, and values are represented as connected nodes in a graph layout. This visualization will help users understand complex JSON relationships and hierarchies through a more visual, spatial representation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between tree view and graph view, so that I can choose the visualization that best suits my data exploration needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads with JSON data THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle or tab interface to switch between tree view and graph view
2. WHEN a user switches to graph view THEN the system SHALL render the same JSON data as an interactive node-link diagram
3. WHEN a user switches back to tree view THEN the system SHALL maintain the current JSON data and any expanded/collapsed states
4. WHEN switching between views THEN the system SHALL preserve search queries and selected elements where applicable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see JSON data represented as connected nodes in a graph, so that I can visualize the relationships and structure in a spatial format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON data contains objects THEN the system SHALL render each object as a node with its key as the node label
2. WHEN JSON data contains arrays THEN the system SHALL render each array as a node with array indices as child nodes
3. WHEN JSON data contains primitive values THEN the system SHALL render them as leaf nodes with appropriate type styling
4. WHEN nodes have relationships THEN the system SHALL draw connecting lines or edges between parent and child nodes
5. WHEN displaying the graph THEN the system SHALL use different colors and shapes to distinguish between objects, arrays, and primitive types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the graph nodes, so that I can explore the JSON structure and access specific data elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a node THEN the system SHALL highlight the node and show a tooltip with key information
2. WHEN a user clicks on a node THEN the system SHALL select the node and highlight its connections
3. WHEN a user double-clicks on a node THEN the system SHALL focus on that node and its immediate connections
4. WHEN a user right-clicks on a node THEN the system SHALL show a context menu with copy options
5. WHEN a user drags a node THEN the system SHALL allow repositioning while maintaining connections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the graph to be automatically laid out in a readable format, so that I can understand the JSON structure without manual arrangement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the graph is first rendered THEN the system SHALL apply an automatic layout algorithm (hierarchical, force-directed, or tree layout)
2. WHEN the JSON structure is deeply nested THEN the system SHALL arrange nodes to minimize edge crossings and overlaps
3. WHEN the graph contains many nodes THEN the system SHALL provide zoom and pan functionality for navigation
4. WHEN nodes are repositioned THEN the system SHALL maintain the layout stability and prevent excessive movement
5. WHEN the JSON data changes THEN the system SHALL smoothly animate the layout transition

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and filter nodes in the graph view, so that I can quickly locate specific data elements in complex JSON structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a search query THEN the system SHALL highlight matching nodes in the graph
2. WHEN search results are found THEN the system SHALL dim non-matching nodes and emphasize matches
3. WHEN a user navigates search results THEN the system SHALL center the view on each matching node
4. WHEN a user clears the search THEN the system SHALL restore the full graph visibility and layout
5. WHEN filtering is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain the graph structure while hiding filtered elements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the graph view to handle large JSON datasets efficiently, so that I can visualize complex data without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the JSON contains more than 100 nodes THEN the system SHALL implement level-of-detail rendering or node clustering
2. WHEN zooming out THEN the system SHALL aggregate smaller nodes into cluster nodes to maintain performance
3. WHEN zooming in THEN the system SHALL expand clusters to show individual nodes
4. WHEN the graph is very large THEN the system SHALL provide a minimap or overview for navigation
5. WHEN rendering many nodes THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth interactions (60fps) during pan and zoom operations
