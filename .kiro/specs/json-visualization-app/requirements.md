# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A JSON visualization app that allows users to input JSON data and view it in a structured, interactive format. The app should make it easy to explore complex JSON structures, validate JSON syntax, and provide a clean user interface for better data comprehension.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input JSON data into the app, so that I can visualize its structure in a readable format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pastes or types JSON data into an input field THEN the system SHALL accept the input and prepare it for visualization
2. WHEN a user provides valid JSON data THEN the system SHALL parse the JSON successfully
3. IF the JSON data is invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages indicating the syntax issues
4. WHEN a user clears the input field THEN the system SHALL reset the visualization area

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see JSON data displayed in a tree-like structure, so that I can easily understand the hierarchy and relationships between data elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN valid JSON is provided THEN the system SHALL render the data as an expandable/collapsible tree structure
2. WHEN a user clicks on an expandable node THEN the system SHALL show or hide its child elements
3. WHEN displaying arrays THEN the system SHALL show array indices and allow expansion of array items
4. WHEN displaying objects THEN the system SHALL show key-value pairs with proper indentation
5. WHEN displaying primitive values THEN the system SHALL show the value with appropriate type formatting (strings, numbers, booleans, null)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the JSON visualization, so that I can explore specific parts of the data structure efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a JSON element THEN the system SHALL highlight the element and show relevant information
2. WHEN a user clicks on a key or value THEN the system SHALL allow copying that specific element
3. WHEN viewing large JSON structures THEN the system SHALL provide search functionality to find specific keys or values
4. WHEN a user expands or collapses nodes THEN the system SHALL maintain the state during the session

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to have a clean and intuitive interface, so that I can focus on the JSON data without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean layout with input area and visualization area clearly separated
2. WHEN JSON is being processed THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (loading indicators)
3. WHEN displaying the visualization THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling and color coding for different data types
4. WHEN the app is used on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and readability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to validate my JSON data, so that I can identify and fix syntax errors quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid JSON is entered THEN the system SHALL highlight the error location in the input
2. WHEN JSON validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide descriptive error messages with line and column information
3. WHEN JSON is valid THEN the system SHALL provide positive confirmation
4. WHEN typing in the input field THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation feedback
