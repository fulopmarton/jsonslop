# JsonSlop 🍲

_When your JSON is a hot mess and you need to make sense of it_

JsonSlop turns your gnarly, nested JSON blobs into beautiful, interactive visualizations. No more squinting at endless brackets or getting lost in object hell. Just paste your JSON chaos and watch it transform into something actually readable.

Built with Vue 3 and D3.js because we believe in using the good stuff.

## What's in the bowl?

- 🔍 **Search & Navigate** - Find that one property buried 47 levels deep
- 🌳 **Tree & Graph Views** - See your data structure like the beautiful mess it is
- ⚡ **Real-time Validation** - Know instantly when your JSON is broken (we've all been there)
- 📋 **Copy Anything** - Grab values, paths, whatever you need
- 🎨 **Clean Interface** - No clutter, just your data doing its thing

## Getting Your Hands Dirty

### First Time Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Fire It Up (Development)

```sh
npm run dev
```

_Opens in your browser, ready to slop some JSON_

### Build for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

_Makes it all neat and tidy for deployment_

### Run the Tests

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

_Because we're not animals_

### Clean Up Your Code

```sh
npm run lint
```

_Keeps things looking professional_

## Dev Setup (If You're Into That)

**Recommended:** [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)

_Pro tip: Disable Vetur if you have it - they don't play nice together_
